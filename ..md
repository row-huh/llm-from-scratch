# Chapter 2

## 2.1 understanding word embeddings
Embeddings are just convertin non numerical data (such as text) into numeric data - this is called word embedding. map each word to a numeric data.
Also there's sentence or paragraph embeddings - mapping sentences/paras to numeric data (used in RAG btw)

word2vec is an embedding model that would figure out the word embeddings by predicting the context of that word given the target or by predicting the target given the context (exact details idk man)  
words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meaning  
Pretrained models are used to generate embeddings for ML models, llms however have their own embeddings in the input layer and are updated during training. Well why not just use word2vec?? here's the thing if you train your own embedding model then you have your data fitting into your context - it will match more with the context of you training data instead of something generic that word2vec will likely produce

Even the smallest gpt2 models with 117M and 125M parameters use an embedding size of 768 dimensions. GPT3 with 175b parameters uses 12,288 dimensions (sheesh)

Summary:
- Embeddings is the process of converting words/sentences(depends) into vectors
- word2vec is a pretrained neural network normally used to generate embeddings for ml models
- llms usually do not use word2vec. They have their own embeddings in the input layer. Think of llms as one neural network - everything is happening within

## 2.2 tokenizing text
now forget embeddings for a while, you need to tokenize text first.
- each word is a token, each special character is a token
- each whitespace is skipped, all others are split into tokens\

so you:
- downloaded the verdict, read it
- to understand tokenization, you write a regex that will split words on each whitespace (to get singular words)
- some words are connected with a punctuation so you're now splitting each punctuation mark too. 
- now loop through each and remove whitespace tokens for the simplicity 

## 2.3 converting tokens into token ids
In this step you will convert all tokens into token ids. This step comes before converting the token ids into embedding vectors. 
So far;
- split text into tokens
- convert into token ids 
- then comes 'embeddings'  
To convert into token ids; 
- just grab all words, create a set to remove duplicates
- use enumerate to assign a number to each and create a dict object - call it `vocab`
- now we'll use this `vocab` to convert all the tokens into token ids. You have a map, now you transform everything according to that map. 
  
![Figure 2.7](md-assets/image.png)  
  

At this point, you have a list of token_ids adjacent to each token so you can convert your original list of tokens into token_ids. 
Now well you need the opposite as well so you create a tokenizer class with an `encode` method that splits text into tokens and carries out the string-to-integer mapping to produce token IDs via the vocabulary and a `decode` method that carries out the reverse integer-to-string mapping to convert the token ids back into text. 
you create the `SimpleTokenizerV1` class for this:

```Python
class SimpleTokenizerV1:
    def __init__(self, vocab):
        self.str_to_int = vocab
        self.int_to_str = { i:s for s,i in vocab.items() }

    def encode(self,text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
        preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids

    def decode(self, ids):
        text = " ".join([self.int_to_str[i] for i in ids])
        text = re.sub(r'\s+([,.?!"()\'])', r'\1', text)
        return text
    
```

Now try using a word which is not available in the vocab - (book used 'hello') and you'll get an error because the vocab does not know what you're saying - as that word wasn't in `the-verdict.txt`



## 2.4 Special context tokens
In 2.3, you encountered an error because the token which was to be encoded wasn't available in `vocab` so now enters `SimpleTokenizerV2` which will encode the words that aren't in `vocab` with a special token `<| unk |>`.

Also whenever concatenating text from different sources, use the `<| end of text |>` special token so that the model knows that these texts are separate - this will help in better 'next-word' prediction thingy as you will be separating the context.   
Now, you take your existing vocab and add two more tokens in it, `<| unk |>` and `<| end of text |>`. then create tokenizerv2 as following:  

```Python
class SimpleTokenizerV2:
    def __init__(self, vocab):
        self.str_to_int = vocab
        self.int_to_str = {i:s for s,i in vocab.items()}
    
    def encode(self, text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.:;?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
        preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]

        preprocessed = [item if item in self.str_to_int else "<|unk|>" for item in preprocessed]
        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids
    
    def decode(self, ids):
        text = " ".join([self.int_to_str[i] for i in ids])
        text = re.sub(r'\s+([,.:;?!"()\'])', r'\1', text)
        return text
```
tldr;  
- For words out of vocab, use the <| unk |> token, and <| EOS |> or <| end of text|> for end of a sentence (helps model understand context)
- gpt tokenizer only uses <| end of text |> token for simplicity
- gpt tokenizer also doesn't use <| unk |> token for out of vocab words instead they use byte pair encoding which breaks down words into subwords

## 2.5 Byte Pair Encoding
(book doesn't go deep  in this but i will, lol)  

BPE looks at data then decides how to tokenize them, went ahead and found out the whole algorithm, it's relatively easy

```
for k times:
    - choose the most frequentyly adjacent symbols (suppose t and h are appearing together a lot)
    - replace every adjacent t and h with th - like link them together
```
note that bpe does not need the `<| unk |>` token as it is iteratively figuring out words and assigning tokens unlike the tokenizing approaches of `SimpleTokenizerV2`. If it encounters an unfamiliar word during tokenization, it can represent it as a sequence of subword tokens or characters. 
The ability to break down unknown words into individual characters ensures that the tokenizer and, consequently, the LLM that is trained with it can process any text, even if it contains words that were not present in its training data  
(Normally used with `tiktoken` - library for tokenizing, duh?)

Just to recap, so far:  
- split text into tokens 
- use those tokens to create `vocab` i.e assign each token a token id
- convert all tokens into token ids
- created `SimpleTokenizerV1` (without special tokens), `SimpleTokenizerV2` (with special tokens) and then finally used `tiktoken` to just use BPE algorithm as BPE is much better at working with new words. if any word is not in its vocab, it will represent it as a collection of tokens


## 2.6 Data Sampling wih a sliding window
LLms are pretrained by predicting the next word in a text;  
  
![alt text](md-assets/image2.png)

Next step is to create input-target pairs.  
You accept a list of inputs then the model predicts the most likely next word for that list of inputs. 

Input is the group of words you feed into an llm  
target would be the word that it should predict  

##### Sliding window Approach: 
Read `the-verdict.txt`, and tokenize using bpe tokenizer
The most intuitive ways to create the input-target pairs for the next word prediction task is to create two variables, x and y, where x contains the input
tokens and y contains the targets, which are the inputs shifted by 1.
Take a chunk of tokens, create x from 0:lastidx and then a y from 1:lastidx+1

```Python
context_size = 4
x = enc_sample[:context_size]
y = enc_sample[1:context_size+1]
print(f"x: {x}")
print(f"y:
{y}")
```
Here, `context_size` is how many tokens would be included in the input. `context_size+ 1`would be the target pairs

#### Data Loader and Dataset classes
One last step before turning tokens into embeddings: implementing an efficient data loader that iterates over the input dataset and returns the inputs and targets as PyTorch tensors, which can be thought of as multidimensional arrays
  
![alt text](md-assets/image3.png)  
  
Creating this class to create input/target pairs in tensors with each tensor created by a skipping-token-amount of `stride` (if that makes sense):  
Each row consists of a number of tokenIDs (based on `max_length`)

```Python
class GPTDatasetV1(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, txt, tokenizer, max_length, stride):
        self.input_ids = []
        self.target_ids = []

        token_ids = tokenizer.encode(txt)

        for i in range(0, len(token_ids) - max_length, stride):
            input_chunk = token_ids[i:1 + max_length]
            target_chunk = token_ids[i + 1: i + max_length + 1]
            self.input_ids.append(torch.tensor(input_chunk))
            self.target_ids.append(torch.tensor(target_chunk))

    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.input_ids)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.input_ids[idx], self.target_ids[idx]

```

The code here was kinda complicating so just to recap:  
- you're creating batches of input and target ids - call them `chunks`
- Think of each `chunk` as a tensor in figure 2.13. target chunk is 1 item shifted of input chunk
- `stride` is how many tokens you will skip through in the next iteration
- the other two methods are self-explanatory

After that, you just create a small function which works as an invoker/instantiator to the gptdatasetv1 class

```
def create_dataloader_v1(txt, batch_size=4, max_length=256, stride=128, shuffle=True, drop_last=True, num_workers=0):
    tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")
    dataset = GPTDatasetV1(txt, tokenizer, max_length, stride)

    dataloader = DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=shuffle,
        drop_last=drop_last,
        num_workers=num_workers
    )

    return dataloader
```

Now, if you need to use the `GPTDatasetV1` class, you will do so with the `create_dataloader_v1` method. `GPTDatasetV1` will create the dataset and `DataLoader` will be also instantiated by the `create_dataloader_v1` class.

**Dataset Class** : represents data - tells pytorch what the data is and how to access individual samples
  
**DataLoader**: provides a way to load batches of data with shuffling and parallel processing

`max_length` will tell you what the maximum number of items should be in each tensor(both input and output). 
Also note `batch-size=1` results in tensor of length 1 (like 2d array, length1, inside the length1 you have `max_length` number of elements). 
Having a `batch_size=8` will result in a tensor of length 8

Smaller batch sizes = Noisy model updates, which is why its normal to have batch sizes over atleast 256.  
However,  
Smaller batch sizes = less memory required during training, so batch size is a tradeoff to experiment wd

Also note, batch_size is the length of a tensor and max_length is the number of items in each inner list (coz multidimensioanl array, remember) 



### 2.7 Create token embeddings
This is the last step.
Embeddings are continuous vector representations and they're necessary since gpt-like llms are deep neural networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm.
(idk how neural networks are trained with backpropagation algorithm and i dont have time right now so i'll use all my knowledge from reading that one AI history book and random geoffrey hinton articles i found on medium which is that you get to the output, then backtrace. Like go back, and adjusst the weights of that node which was activated to get to that output and if im not wrong you do this for each hidden layer)  

To understand how token id to embedding vector conversion works, take four token ids, small vocab (6 words) and u want to create an embedding size of 3 (note that embedding size is dimensions and its normal to have a lott of those, gpt 3 has 12, 288 - jeez)


- embeddings are vector representation of tokens. 
- In training, you have tokens, you assign a random embedding to all of them then you try predicting the next word in a sentence - this would mostly be wrong so you go back (back propagation) to figure where the error came from then you calculate loss and all to adjust embedding vector values plus some weights now your model is slightly better. repeat this a 1000 times until your model gets better. 
- `vocab_size` and `output_dim` is the dimension of the resulting tensor embedding thingy

- embedding layer is the first real layer of the llm neural network except it's not a layer in the traditional sense - it works as a map. it has a tensor that contains one row per token id and that row is the adjacent embedding. It will map the token id resulting in an output of a 'continuous vector representation' or most commonly known as its gangsta name `embedding`  

In other words, the embedding layer is essen-
tially a lookup operation that retrieves rows from the embedding layer’s weight matrix
via a token ID.

To recap, so far:
- you tokenize words  
- you map them to a vocab providing a token id for each
- you have to now map them into input-target pairs
- then you use batches and stuff to come up with tensors with bunch of parameters such as `max_length` (max token per row), `stride` (how many tokens to skip before moving on to the next per batch) using `Dataset` class (responsible for creating effective datasets with proper batching and input/target pairs) and a `DataLoader` class which will aid in fetching input/target tensors one by one
- then finally, you convert these input tensors into embedding layeer. You already know the outputs (input/target pairs, remember?) so you're gonna help the llm learn better which inputs are to be mapped to which outputs. Note that embeddings are assumed at first then gradually adjusted during the training process


### 2.8 Encoding word positions
The token id remains the same regardless of it's position and regardless of how far apart it is. Now you can think of a problem here, 
imagine two sentences "I dont think this is working" and "I like this", the position of "this" and "i" in both of the sentences has variable lengths but the words in both of these sentences will have the same token id. "this" in sentence 1 and sentence 2 will have the same token id even though they are used in different contexts and you can see how the model will have probs figuring out what words to pay attention to if they just have the same token ids.  

To solve this, there's two broad categories of position-aware embeddings (embeddings unlike the ones described above, they are aware of the "context" so to speak)  

- **Absolute Positional Embeddings**:  
. Absolute Positional Embeddings are directly associated with specific positions in a sequence. 


- **Relative Positional Embeddings**:  
Relative positional embeddings will tell you relationships based on how far apart instead of "at wihch exact position". this will help generalizing better to variable sequence length

(GPT models use absolute positional embeddings, instead of fixed positional encodings in the original transformer model)

To implement this, follow the following steps:  
- Load raw text from "the-verdict.txt"  
- Define vocabulary size and embedding dimension  
- Create an embedding layer to map token IDs to 256-dimensional vectors
- Tokenize text and prepare batches using create_dataloader_v1, with sliding windows
- Fetch one batch of input and target token IDs
- Convert token IDs to embeddings via the token embedding layer
- Create a positional embedding layer for max_length positions
- Generate absolute positional embeddings (one per position index)
- Add token and positional embeddings together to get final input  embeddings for 

## Chapter 2 Summary:
Summary
- LLMs require textual data to be converted into numerical vectors, known as
embeddings, since they can’t process raw text. Embeddings transform discrete
data (like words or images) into continuous vector spaces, making them com-
patible with neural network operations.
- As the first step, raw text is broken into tokens, which can be words or characters.
Then, the tokens are converted into integer representations, termed token IDs.
- Special tokens, such as <|unk|> and <|endoftext|>, can be added to enhance
the model’s understanding and handle various contexts, such as unknown
words or marking the boundary between unrelated texts.
the model
- The byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer used for LLMs like GPT-2 and GPT-3
can efficiently handle unknown words by breaking them down into subword
units or individual characters.
- We use a sliding window approach on tokenized data to generate input–target
pairs for LLM training.
- Embedding layers in PyTorch function as a lookup operation, retrieving vectors
corresponding to token IDs. The resulting embedding vectors provide continu-
ous representations of tokens, which is crucial for training deep learning mod-
els like LLMs.
- While token embeddings provide consistent vector representations for each
token, they lack a sense of the token’s position in a sequence. To rectify this,
two main types of positional embeddings exist: absolute and relative. OpenAI’s
GPT models utilize absolute positional embeddings, which are added to the token
embedding vectors and are optimized during the model training.



# Chapter 3
So far, tokenize text, convert into token ids, create embeddings.
Now comes the attention mechanism part
