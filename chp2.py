# tokenize (using the regex approach)

# sort all and convert into set to remove duplicates

# enumerate each item and store in a dict object (call it vocabulary)

# introduce <| unk |> and <| end of text|> special tokens into your vocabulary as well

# create a class that takes in text, creates a vocab, tokenizes other text
# based on that vocab and if any word doesnt exist, it will use a special token
